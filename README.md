# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms Journey in C++

A systematic collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into three main sections for better scalability and navigation:

### 1. 🛠️ [cpp_basics](./cpp_basics)
Contains fundamental concepts of C++, memory management, and basic logic building.

### 2. ⚡ [algorithms](./algorithms)
Implementation of standard algorithms with a focus on time and space complexity.
* **Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.
* **Searching:** Optimized Linear and Binary Search implementations.

### 3. 🧩 [problems](./problems)
Problem-solving practice categorized by technique and data structure:
* **01_Maths:** Integer Logic & Bitwise Operations.
* **02_Arrays:**
    * `01_Basics_And_logic`: Fundamental array operations.
    * `02_Frequency_And_Hashing`: Frequency counting and mapping problems.
    * `03_Two_pointers`: $O(N)$ optimization techniques for sorted and unsorted data.
    * `04_Binary_search`: Logarithmic search space reduction.
    * `05_SubArrays_Sliding_Window`: Subarray sums, Kadane's Algorithm, and window-based optimizations.
* **03_Strings:** Implementing character manipulation, merging, and difference-finding logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
